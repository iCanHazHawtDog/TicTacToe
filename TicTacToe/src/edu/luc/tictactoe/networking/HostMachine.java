 * 
 * The HostMachine class implements Runnable because we do not want to always block the main
 * UI thread. Also implements INetworking because we want the guarantee that we have certain
 * methods such as sendMessage().
 * 
 * The typical logic of the networking is as follows:
 * 
 * 1. User selects that they wish to be host machine
 * 2. User retrieves IP address and port number of their machine instance
 * 3. User waits for client/another player to connect
 * 4. When the other player connects, the first message to be sent by the server is going to be "hello"-
 * this confirms that a connection with the server has been made, and starts off a "handshake process"
 * 5. The host sends its players name, the client receives and confirms that it has received the name
 * 6. The client sends its players name, the host received and confirms that is has received the name
 * 7. A player is chosen to start the game, the host machine will always choose which player has been chosen to
 * start the game
 * 8. The host sends the client who will be starting
 * 9. If the host is starting, the client waits for a move from the host
 * 10. If the client is starting, the host waits for a move from the client
 * 11. The moves are made via the sendMessage(String message) dialog. 
 * 12. If the connection is interrupted, an error is thrown and the game is ended- nothing is recorded as a win or loss
 * 13. If the game is paused, the pause sends a message to show that the game has been paused
 * 14. If the game has ended, the winner is recoded and the connection is terminated.
