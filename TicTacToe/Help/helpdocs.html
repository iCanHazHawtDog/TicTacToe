<h4><a name="machine">On this Machine Vs. AI</a></h3>
<p>Entering the player name and clicking on this button allows you to start playing a game against the computer. In playing against the

<p>The message in the window "Waiting for Connection..." means that it is currently in a wait state until 
another person player on the Internet is interested in a networked game.</p>
<p>If a networked player is found, the first-In person hosts the game. Once the game session starts, the number of game 
rounds won is also counted for each player.</p>
<p>At the end of the game, different messages are displayed to each player and the player hosting the game is expected to continue.</p>

<p>Pending the time the host player decides to continue the game, the message "Waiting for the first player to continue" is displayed to the second player.</p>

<h4><a name="pg">Play </a></h3>
<p>After the play board opens, the left top corner has information on the player names and their symbols (X or O), left bottom corner has information on player turn,
 and the right screen has the board. The players can play the game by clicking on the board cells during their turns only. </p>
